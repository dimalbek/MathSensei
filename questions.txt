1,000 milligrams (mg). One cup of milk contains 299 mg of calcium and
one cup of juice contains 261 mg of calcium. Which of the following

juice, j, a 20-year-old person could drink in a day to meet or exceed the
recommended daily calcium intake from these drinks alone?
A) 299m + 261j ≥ 1,000
B) 299m + 261j > 1,000
C) 299/m + 261/j ≥ 1,000
D) 299/m + 261/j > 1,000

A research assistant selected 75 undergraduate students at random from
the list of all students enrolled in the psychology-degree program at a large
university. She asked each of the 75 students, “How many minutes per day
do you typically spend reading?” The mean reading time in the sample was
89 minutes, and the margin of error for this estimate was 4.28 minutes.
Another research assistant intends to replicate the survey and will attempt
to get a smaller margin of error. Which of the following samples will most
likely result in a smaller margin of error for the estimated mean time
students in the psychology-degree program read per day?
A) 40 undergraduate psychology-degree program students selected at
random
B) 40 undergraduate students selected at random from all degree
programs at the university
C) 300 undergraduate psychology-degree program students selected at
random
D) 300 undergraduate students selected at random from all degree
programs at the university
